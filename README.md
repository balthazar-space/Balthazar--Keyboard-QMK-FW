# balthazarKeyboardQMK

Balthazar open-hardware laptop - QMK firmware https://docs.qmk.fm/ for keyboard and touchpad module

QMK firmware is a natural solution for ATmega 32u4 based keyboards. Copy the balthazar folder above into keyboards folder of your qmk_firmware installation. 

balthazar_default.hex is a compiled default keymap version. It is for caterina bootloader ATmega 32u4 chips taken from Chinese Sparkfun Pro Micro clones.

At this point only the default keymap is tested: no touchpad, no oled display, etc.
